OK?
Can test ?
yes

Not working
wait, we are suppose to use api. :)

OK
wait here, am disconnecting and connect again,..hold on

Something is missing here...this is the original code..check skype


$socks  = BASEURL."buyer/PortChecker.php?host=$url&port=$port";
$socks2 = file_get_contents($socks);

if (preg_match('#Success!#', $socks2)) {
    $urltoapi  = BASEURL."SMTPSend.php?host=$url&login=$login&pass=$pass&port=$port&id=$id&testmail=$testemail";
    $urltoapi2 = file_get_contents($urltoapi)


Now, do you understand this part?

Just a moment.
Let me check.


It's using the socket. Right ? yes! now you understand? Understood

This code is working now ? yes, fix api and let's see

173.44.227.120:12345:78956467:hq5635gh
173.44.227.149:12345:78956467:hq5635gh
181.214.3.124:12345:78956467:hq5635gh
181.214.3.85:12345:78956467:hq5635gh
185.158.105.177:12345:78956467:hq5635gh


This code is checking the mail server.


I use this code.
Can you see ?
yes

Then what is proxy ?
What is the BASEURL?

The baseurl is https://vpox.to/vpox/
$socks2 = file_get_contents($socks); What does this mean?

This call above url and get content of the result.
$urltoapi: this is what? 

This is the url that send the test mail.
in this case, show me the url that sends test email.

https://vpox.to/vpox/SMTPSend.php?host=mail.wbs.ne.jp&login=nissyou-setu@mail.wbs.ne.jp&pass=nissyou1&port=587&id=640&testmail=dmbdev800@gmail.com

I hope you can see api there? That is  to fetch proxy from other website

No noi
That is  to fetch proxy from other website
You are wrong.

That send the test mail with smtp host.
wait a moment, can you code in c++

C++?
What do you mean ?
I think this is the solution to the proxy problem..look this

This is my code.
But it's not working.
Do you understand ?

just wait
